## Platform that allows access to specific, important information that are typically difficult to find
## Customer Usage:  
Customers have either the option of texting the business phone number information or using our mobile application to find/select the business and message from there.
Customers can use Natural Language in the text messages to ask for specific information. 
Our server will process the request, fetch the correct information, and send a reply text with the information. This makes it convenient for customers to find specific information that could otherwise take some time to look up or be difficult to find. Also,because the response is by our server and database, the business being inquired about is not interrupted by repeated questions.  
Example: "Are you open today and if so, what are the store hours?"  
Response from our server: "Yes, we are open today from 9am to 5pm."
